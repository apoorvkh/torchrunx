We use the [`pixi`](https://pixi.sh) package manager. Simply [install `pixi`](https://pixi.sh/latest/#installation) and run `pixi shell` in this repository. We use `ruff` for linting and formatting, `pyright` for static type checking, and `pytest` for testing. We build for `PyPI`. Our release pipeline is powered by Github Actions.
